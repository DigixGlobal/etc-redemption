# Digix ETC Redemption User Guide

Please read and understand this document fully to minimize the risk of lost funds during the ETC Redemption process.

## Overview

This document is a guide for DGD holders outlining the required steps for redeeming ETC. For background, please review previous announcements and documentation on the ETC redemption contract.

DGD holders are credited with DGDR tokens on the ETC chain, which can be used to call the `redeem(_to)` method on the DGDR contract and exchange them for an equivalent ETC balance. This requires executing a transaction on the ETC chain using the same keystore that holds DGD on the main chain. There are several methods available, which one used depends on the DGDR holder's keystore type and security/convenience preferences.

The sender of the redemption transaction (DGDR holder) will need a small amount of ETC to preform the transaction. An ETC Faucet is provided to DGD holders with a 1-time use - visit https://digixparity04.digix.io/faucet/0x_YOUR_ADDRESS_HERE (replace with your DGD address).

##Â Exchanges

DGD held in the following centralized exchanges on the Snapshot block will be automatically funded with the ETC balance. Please contact your exchange for details:

* Yunbi
* Bittrex
* Gatecoin

Please remove your tokens from decentralized exchanges.

## Replay Attack Concerns

ETC and ETH addresses are compatible with each other, so you can generate wallets in an ETH client and use it on the ETC chain. There is however the possibility of transactions being replayed from one chain to the other when using older clients or firmware. There is also the possibility of old transactions being replayed if a previously unfunded account becomes funded.

For this reason, when using ETC, try to keep it separate from accounts that have ever used or received ETH.

The `redeem` method on the Redemption Contract needs to be passed an address; `_to` should be set to:

* A *different* (preferably new) ETC address that you control, to prevent potential replay attacks
* A standard address that you can access the keystore of; **NOT an exchange or contract address!**

Additionally, DGDR uses Ethereum's token 'standard' and it can be used on many ERC20-compatible applications. DGDR balances are burned entirely (to 0) on redemption to prevent double spends.

## Note for those holding DGD in a Smart Contract

For those who hold their DGD balances in a contract address that does not exist on the ETC chain, several options are provided:

* Best Advice: Move the DGDs into a regular address before the Snapshot Block
* Alternatively: Move the DGDs into an Exchange before the Snapshot Block
* If you were unable to do this, contact Digix to manually process redemption - we will need you to sign a transaction on ETH chain from the contract to prove ownership.

## Redemption Contract Address

DO NOT SEND DGD OR ETC TO THIS ADDRESS

DGDR Contract Address: `0x1312f9EC97a2377c8e2Ba6f088AfdFedFe59398C`.

Source code verified: https://gastracker.io/contract/0x1312f9ec97a2377c8e2ba6f088afdfedfe59398c

The address can also be found in the [ETC Redemption Dapp](https://etc-redemption.digix.global/).

## ABI (just the `redeem` method)

```json
[{ "constant": false, "inputs": [{ "name": "_to", "type": "address" }], "name": "redeem", "outputs": [], "payable": false, "type": "function" }]
```

## Recommended Methods for sending `redeem` transaction

- [Spectrum (bespoke UI)](#spectrum)
- [MyEtherWallet](#myetherwallet)
- [Parity](#parity)
- [Geth](#geth) (CLI - advanced)

At present the most battle-tested client is MEW. You can also use the newer (but less tested) Spectrum (by Digix), which has a UI built specifically for the ETC Redemption Contract. These web clients support a range of different features:

- Keystore File (UTC / JSON)
- Ledger Nano S 1.2+ *
- Offline Signing
- TREZOR (MEW only)
- Mnemonic Phrase (MEW Only)
- Parity Phrase (MEW Only)

\* IF using the Ledger Nano S, you need at least firmware version 1.2, but it appears that v 1.2 does not support eip-155 replay protection. This is not an issue if you are only using it to sign the `redeem` method (as this cannot be replayed), but if you are doing any other transactions, it's advised to upgrade to at least v1.3 firmware, which prevents replays in Spectrum and MyEtherWallet.

### Geth (Ethereum Classic)

Download the [Ethereum Classic Geth Client](https://github.com/ethereumproject/go-ethereum) and use the CLI or [truffle](http://truffleframework.com/) :)

## Proper Decentralized Options

Should all of the public RPC nodes become unavailable for some reason such as a Denial of Service attack, or you just prefer to be decentralized, you can still publish the redemption transaction by running a local ETC node. We would recommend using either Parity, or for hardware wallets, the [local dist version of MEW](https://github.com/kvhnuke/etherwallet#users-non-developers) and either Parity of Geth (ETC Fork).

With Spectrum, you can also visit the latest version online via an IPFS gateway:

`<latest_ipfs_hash> = QmfTV1YaHF5Rwd12cBmGrSRoiDGxNcFzweTLERetZWgfA7` (updated 30/5/17)

Current Release: https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/QmfTV1YaHF5Rwd12cBmGrSRoiDGxNcFzweTLERetZWgfA7/

* https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/<latest_ipfs_hash>
* https://ipfs.infura.io/ipfs/<latest_ipfs_hash>
* http://localhost:8090/<latest_ipfs_hash>

### Running Spectrum Locally

Running over HTTP allows you to connect to a local RPC instance running on http:// (such as parity or geth)

You create a folder that is small and portable and can be easily hosted or copied and used from a USB drive

The recommended method is to install [IPFS](https://github.com/ipfs/go-ipfs) locally, and start it using `ipfs daemon`:

You can then navigate to a local gateway:

http://localhost:8090/ipfs/<latest_ipfs_hash>

Or you can copy Spectrum and run locally

```bash
$ ipfs get <latest_ipfs_hash> -o spectrum
Saving file(s) to spectrum
4.54 MB / 4.54 MB [================================================] 100.00% 0s
$ cd spectrum
$ open index.html # opens in browser, or start static server instead
```

In modern versions of chrome, you can simple save `cmd & s` and select `Web Page, Complete` to save a working offline version of Spectrum (although right now the icons don't work - fix incoming).
